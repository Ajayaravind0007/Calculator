# Calculator
This is a source code of a simple calculator application developed using Kivy package in python.
I developed a simple calculator using python which could process arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of both float and integer numbers. Since it is developed using kivy, It could be employed to mostly all platforms.
